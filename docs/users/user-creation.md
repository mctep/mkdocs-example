## Requirements

- Python 3
- pip
- Genestack Python client installed and setup with a user account/token.
  See [how to setup Genestack Python client](../packages-to-install/genestack-python-client.md)
- Auxiliary scripts installed.
  See [how to install Genestack auxiliary scripts](../packages-to-install/genestack-auxiliary-scripts.md)
- A users.tsv file, for example: [users.tsv](users.tsv)

## Instructions

1. Edit [users.tsv](users.tsv) file in the text editor and replace the example users with your own users - one line per user, detailing email and name, separated by a tab.
2. Run the script below and follow its login instructions, replacing the host name with the address of the instance the script will apply:

   `$ odm-create-users -H localhost:8080`\
   or use the -u parameter and the user alias created when setting up the Genestack client

   `$ odm-create-users -u your_alias`

3. The script will create new users and print out their passwords, for example:

   ```
     alice@alphacorp.com    uNgp4F6C    Alice
     bob@alphacorp.com      xI3AOf2h    Bob
   ```
